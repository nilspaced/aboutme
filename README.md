Hi,
 I go by Spoon, Ink or Nil. I'm 18 years old, please don't be weird around me if you're a minor

I go it/its or any dehumanizing pronouns (ex. that/thats). I may use mirror pronouns sometimes so just be wary. I sometimes prefer to go by no pronouns at times, I will lyk. <3 Also FYI i'd rather not be called by they/them it just doesn't sit right with me. Learn more about my Identity w my pronouns page! I suggest you read it before interacting with me.

I like alot of things and I'm Multifandom. But my main fandoms are most if not all popular roblox fandoms (mainly phighting), DnB (dave and bambi), IHNMAIMS (I have no mouth and I must scream), alot of minecraft smps (mainly lssmp, msp, dsmp and uusmp), roblox myths and roblox ARGS.

If you want to make me happy, some of my favorite (comfort) charcaters are Aubree, AM, Ivan, Painbody (esp painbody) and Catshot.

I like shoe gaze, alternative rock, death metal, metal, rap rock and any pop song that sounds good honestly.

I've been diagnosed with AUDHD and BPD, be patient with me. I tend to have explosive episodes that I CANNOT CONTROL. I'm not asking for you to comfort me, but you must tell me if you're uncomfortable with how I'm acting since I'm bad at social cues. I also tend to be overly negative and standoffish and this is just my personality, I try to help it but sometimes I can't. I may also be overly friendly, it's just because I'm shy.
