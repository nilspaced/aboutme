Hi,
I'm Asp (also know as AspPoint.) I also go by Spoon, Ink or Nil.

I go it/its or any dehumanizing pronouns (ex. that/thats). I may use mirror pronouns sometimes so just be wary. I sometimes prefer to go by no pronouns at times, I will lyk. <3 Also FYI i'd rather not be called by they/them it just doesn't sit right with me. Learn more about my Identity w my pronouns page! I suggest you read it before interacting with me.

I like alot of things and I'm Multifandom. But my main fandoms are most if not all popular roblox fandoms, DnB (dave and bambi), IHNMAIMS (I have no mouth and I must scream) and roblox ARGS.

I've been diagnosed with AUDHD and BPD, be patient with me. I tend to have explosive episodes that I CANNOT CONTROL. I'm not asking for you to comfort me, but you must tell me if you're uncomfortable with how I'm acting since I'm bad at social cues. I also tend to be overly negative and standoffish and this is just my personality, I try to help it but sometimes I can't. I may also be overly friendly, it's just because I'm shy.
